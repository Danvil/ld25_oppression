### Ludum Dare 25: Oppression

This is the source code for an [Ludum Dare Game Compo](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/) entry. Ludum Dare Compo is a 48 hour game creation contest.

The theme for the 25-th competition was ["You are the villian!"](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-25/)

In my entry, ["Oppression"](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-25/?action=preview&uid=5851), you control small squads of bribed policemen to oppress the innocent civilians in a small town.
